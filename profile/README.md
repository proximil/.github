### Why this? 
I got the inspiration for this idea while walking down my block, and I saw someone with a bag, a laptop exiting his car, my first thought was that "is he into tech? can i talk to him? should i 'connect' with him?"
but i walked away... <br>
**Then this idea striked my mind, that why not develop a hyperlocal networking website??** <br>
Then after the regular anxious research and surfing on internet thinking 'does this already exist'? I saw that such a simple idea doesn't exist yet?
<br>
I decided to pick it up, and coincidentally i got selected for buildspace, and i chose this ideas as my project for the next 6 weeks
